"""Entry point for Mimirheim — Home Integrated Energy Optimiser.

This module is the application's main entry point. It is responsible for:

1. Parsing the ``--config`` command-line argument.
2. Loading and validating the YAML configuration file.
3. Constructing all application components (ReadinessState, MqttClient,
   MqttPublisher) and wiring them together.
4. Starting the MQTT network loop.
5. Running the solve loop on the main thread until SIGTERM or SIGINT.
6. Exiting cleanly.

What this module does not do:
- Solving: delegated to ``model_builder.build_and_solve``.
- Parsing MQTT payloads: delegated to ``io.input_parser``.
- Publishing results: delegated to ``io.mqtt_publisher``.
- Tracking readiness: delegated to ``core.readiness``.
