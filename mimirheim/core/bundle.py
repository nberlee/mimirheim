"""Runtime input and output models for a single mimirheim solve cycle.

This module defines two groups of Pydantic models:

Timestamped forecast step models (carried on MQTT, consumed by ReadinessState):
    PriceStep, PowerForecastStep

Input models (assembled each solve cycle from live MQTT values):
    BatteryInputs, EvInputs, DeferrableWindow, SolveBundle

Output models (produced by build_and_solve and published to MQTT / golden files):
    DeviceSetpoint, ScheduleStep, SolveResult

All models use ``extra="forbid"`` so that typos in field names and unexpected
payload fields are caught at the boundary rather than silently ignored.

This module has no imports from ``mimirheim.io`` or ``mimirheim.config``. It is the shared
vocabulary between the IO layer (which populates the models) and the solver core
(which consumes them). Neither layer needs to know about the other.

    resampled to the 15-minute solver grid and clipped to the available horizon
    at assembly time. Passed as a single validated argument to
    ``build_and_solve()``, which is a pure function with no I/O.

    ``model_dump()`` of this object is the canonical format for debug dump
    input files and golden file input files (see IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS §4, §5).

    Attributes:
        strategy: Active optimisation strategy name. Populated from the
            ``mimir/input/strategy`` MQTT topic. Defaults to ``"minimize_cost"``
            when that topic has not been received.
        solve_time_utc: Start of the 15-minute slot in which this solve
            occurred. Always floored to the slot boundary (e.g. a trigger at
            19:34 UTC yields 19:30 UTC). Used as the origin for all
            step-to-datetime conversions: EV and deferrable load window
            mapping, schedule step timestamps, and chart publisher alignment.
        triggered_at_utc: Wall-clock UTC time when the trigger message was
            received and ``snapshot()`` was called. Unlike ``solve_time_utc``
            this is not floored; it is the actual moment the solve was
            initiated. Used for dump file naming and human-visible labels (so
            two solves that fall in the same 15-minute slot can be
            distinguished). May be ``None`` when a bundle is constructed
            outside the normal IO loop (tests, benchmarks).
        horizon_prices: Import price in EUR/kWh for each fifteen-minute step
            in the horizon. Length is dynamic (at least 1) — exactly the number
            of steps available from aligned data coverage across all forecasts.
        horizon_export_prices: Export price (feed-in tariff) in EUR/kWh for
            each step. May be zero or negative in markets with export charges.
        horizon_confidence: Forecast confidence in [0, 1] per step, sourced
            from price step confidence. The solver scales objective terms by
            this value; low-confidence steps are conservatively weighted.
        pv_forecast: PV generation forecast in kW per step. Positive = power
            flowing from the PV array into the home. Sum of all configured
            PV arrays, resampled to the 15-minute grid with a hold-previous
            step function.
        pv_forecasts: Per-array PV forecast in kW per step, keyed by
            pv_arrays device name. The power balance uses these; the summed
            pv_forecast is retained for the naive-cost baseline and for
            backward-compatible dump files.
        base_load_forecast: Forecast of non-controllable (static) household
            load in kW per step. Sum of all configured static loads, resampled
            the same way.
        battery_inputs: Keyed by battery device name (matching config). Empty
            if no batteries are configured or their MQTT state is stale.
        ev_inputs: Keyed by EV device name. Empty if no EV is plugged in.

class SolveResult(BaseModel):
    """Complete output of one mimirheim solve cycle.

    Returned by ``build_and_solve()`` and consumed by both the MQTT publisher
    and the golden file test infrastructure.

    ``model_dump()`` of this object is written as ``golden.json`` in scenario
    test directories and is also the payload of the ``mimir/strategy/schedule``
    MQTT topic (see IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS §4).

    Attributes:
        strategy: The strategy that was active during this solve.
        solve_time_utc: The 15-minute slot boundary that step 0 of ``schedule``
            refers to, copied from ``SolveBundle.solve_time_utc``. This is the
            single time origin for the whole result: every consumer that needs
            to turn a step index into a wall-clock time must use it rather than
            reading the clock, otherwise a result published or re-published
            later is silently attributed to the wrong quarter hour. ``None``
            only for results constructed outside ``build_and_solve`` (tests and
            golden files predating this field).
        objective_value: The objective function value returned by the solver.
            The sign convention follows the solver: lower is better for
            minimisation strategies.
        solve_status: One of ``"optimal"`` (provably optimal), ``"feasible"``
            (time-limited incumbent found but not proven optimal), or
            ``"infeasible"`` (no feasible solution exists). When infeasible,
            ``schedule`` is empty and the previous retained schedule is used.
        naive_cost_eur: Estimated cost in EUR of the naive baseline over the
            horizon: grid covers any shortfall between base load and PV at each
            step, with no storage dispatch. Computed as
            ``sum(max(0, base_load[t] - pv[t]) * import_price[t] * dt)``.
            Zero for infeasible solves.
        optimised_cost_eur: Raw grid cash flow in EUR of the solved schedule:
            import cost minus export revenue, with no adjustment for stored
            energy. Computed as
            ``sum(grid_import[t] * import_price[t] * dt - grid_export[t] * export_price[t] * dt)``.
            Zero for infeasible solves.
        soc_credit_eur: Estimated future value in EUR of the net change in
            stored energy across all batteries and EVs over the horizon.
            Positive when the horizon ends with more energy stored than it
            started with. Computed as
            ``avg_import_price × soc_delta_cell_kwh × avg_discharge_eff``
            per device, summed across all storage devices. Add this to
            ``optimised_cost_eur`` to compare fairly against ``naive_cost_eur``:
            ``effective_cost = optimised_cost_eur - soc_credit_eur``.
            Zero for infeasible solves.
        schedule: Ordered list of ScheduleStep objects, one per time step in
            the horizon. Empty if the solve was infeasible.
        deferrable_recommended_starts: Solver-chosen start datetimes for
            deferrable loads that were in binary scheduling state during this
            solve. Keyed by device name. The value is the UTC datetime of the
            first step where the schedule assigns nonzero power to the load.
            Only present for loads that were actively optimised; absent for
            loads in running, committed, or unscheduled state.
