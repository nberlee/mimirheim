"""model_builder — assembles and solves the MILP for one mimirheim cycle.

This module is the entry point for the solver pipeline. The single public
function ``build_and_solve`` takes a ``SolveBundle`` (runtime inputs) and a
``MimirheimConfig`` (static configuration), constructs the full MILP model, solves
it, and returns a ``SolveResult``.

``build_and_solve`` is a **pure function**: it has no side effects, no I/O,
and no shared mutable state. It does not log, write files, or publish to MQTT.
Callers are responsible for all of those actions.

The ``debug_dump`` helper is also defined here but is called by the solve loop
in ``__main__``, not inside ``build_and_solve``.

This module imports from ``mimirheim.core``, ``mimirheim.config``, and ``mimirheim.devices``
but never from ``mimirheim.io``.

def build_and_solve(bundle: SolveBundle, config: MimirheimConfig) -> SolveResult:
    """Build and solve the MILP optimisation model for the current time horizon.

    This is the central function of mimirheim. It takes a validated snapshot of all
    current inputs (prices, forecasts, device states) and the static system
    configuration, constructs a linear programme, solves it, and returns the
    optimal schedule.

    The function is a pure function with no I/O side effects. It does not read
    from MQTT, write files, or log. Callers are responsible for obtaining the
    inputs and acting on the result.

    Steps:
        1. Derive ``horizon`` and ``dt`` from the length of
           ``bundle.horizon_prices``.
        2. Create a fresh ``CBCSolverBackend`` and ``ModelContext``.
        3. Instantiate all device objects from ``config``.
        4. Give every group of two or more batteries or EV chargers a shared
           direction binary, then call ``add_variables(ctx)`` on all devices.
        5. Call ``add_constraints(ctx, inputs)`` on all devices, passing the
           relevant slice of ``bundle`` to each.
        6. Add the power balance constraint for each time step:
           ``sum(d.net_power(t) for d in all_devices) + grid.net_power(t) == 0``.
        7. Call ``ObjectiveBuilder().build(...)`` to set the objective. For
           the ``minimize_consumption`` strategy this also runs a phase-1
           solve internally; ``build`` returns the solver budget that remains.
        8. Call ``ctx.solver.solve()`` with that remaining budget.
        9. If infeasible, return an empty ``SolveResult``.
        10. Extract variable values and assemble ``SolveResult``.

    Args:
        bundle: Validated snapshot of all runtime inputs for this solve cycle.
            Assembled from the latest retained MQTT values by the IO layer.
        config: Validated static system configuration loaded at startup.

    Returns:
        ``SolveResult`` containing the full schedule and solve metadata. If the
        solver finds no feasible solution, ``solve_status`` is ``"infeasible"``
        and ``schedule`` is empty.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``bundle`` and ``config`` are internally inconsistent
            (e.g. a device named in ``bundle.battery_inputs`` has no matching
            entry in ``config.batteries``).

    # When two or more batteries are present, they could individually choose
    # opposite directions (A charges, B discharges) in the same step. Because
    # each battery's efficiency and wear cost must be paid, a roundtrip always
    # delivers less net stored energy than the alternative (A and B both idle,
    # or only B charging). The efficiency terms in the objective already

    # be in the same direction (1=charge, 0=discharge) per step. This adds
    # one binary variable per step — negligible MILP overhead at residential
    # scale — and enforces the physical principle that energy should not loop.
    #
    # When only one battery is present the constraint is unnecessary; the
    # per-device mode created by add_variables is used unchanged.

    # The same logic applies to EV chargers regardless of V2H capability.
    # For charge-only EVs the discharge bound is trivially non-binding, so
    # the shared variable is harmless but maintains uniform activation logic.

    # This runs before add_variables so that a device handed a shared binary

    # Why closed-loop device variables are NOT suppressed for zero-exchange steps
    # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    # The post-process arbitration layer (control_arbitration.py) will later mark
    # certain steps as ``zero_exchange_active=True`` for the selected enforcer
    # device. One might expect the solver variable for that device on that step
    # to be fixed at zero (since the hardware will act autonomously). Do not do
    # this. The reasons are:
    #
    # 1. SOC continuity: the battery or EV state-of-charge variable is threaded
    #    across all steps. If the solver variable for a device is suppressed on
    #    step t, the SOC equation for step t+1 becomes incorrect — the model
    #    thinks the device is idle but the hardware may be charging or discharging.
    #    Wrong SOC estimates on adjacent steps lead to incorrect dispatch on the
    #    steps immediately before and after the closed-loop window.
    #
    # 2. Best prediction: the solver's planned setpoint is the best available
    #    prediction of what the hardware will actually do in closed-loop mode.
    #    The hardware's firmware PID loop will chase zero exchange; the solver
    #    models the same goal via its economic objective. The planned setpoints
    #    are advisory; the hardware enforces the physical constraint autonomously.
    #
    # 3. Self-correction: if the hardware does not precisely track the solver's
    #    planned setpoint (expected — firmware loops are not perfect), the next
    #    solve cycle self-corrects automatically by reading the fresh SOC from
    #    MQTT and re-solving with the updated state.

    When the solver charges storage at cheap prices, the raw grid cash flow
    increases (import cost rises). This credit quantifies what that investment

    ``delta_kwh`` is the net energy the device took in across the horizon,
    measured at the AC terminals: ``ac_kw`` is positive when discharging and
    negative when charging, so negating the sum gives energy absorbed. It is
    deliberately an AC-side figure rather than the cell-side SOC delta the
    schedule also carries in ``DeviceSetpoint.soc_kwh``. Charge efficiency is
    therefore treated as 1 at this stage and only the discharge efficiency is
    applied when pricing the credit, which slightly overstates the value of
    energy taken in. The error is small relative to the rounding already
    applied to the published figures, and using the AC side keeps the credit
    directly comparable with ``optimised_cost_eur``, which is also an AC-side
    cash flow.

    A positive credit means the horizon ends with more stored energy than it

    The output file is a post-processed version of ``SolveResult`` with:

    - Null device fields (``power_limit_kw``, ``zero_exchange_active``, ``loadbalance_active``) omitted.
    - Per-step import and export prices added (from the corresponding bundle
