"""ReadinessState — per-topic freshness tracking and SolveBundle assembly.

This module tracks the latest validated input for each expected MQTT topic and
assembles a complete ``SolveBundle`` when all required inputs are present and
sufficiently covered.

``ReadinessState`` is the bridge between the MQTT IO layer (which receives raw
messages and calls ``update()``) and the solver core (which calls ``snapshot()``
to get a validated bundle). The IO layer and the solver core never communicate
directly; they share only the ``ReadinessState`` instance.

Readiness model:

    **Live sensor readings** (battery SOC, EV SOC, plug state):
        Presence-only check. A reading blocks the solve only if it has never
        been received. Once a value is stored it remains valid indefinitely;
        the most recently published retained message is always authoritative.
        This relies on MQTT retain: mimirheim reads the stored value on (re)connect
        so there is no startup gap, and the broker-side retained message is the
        single source of truth for current hardware state.

    **Forecast series** (prices, PV generation, base load):
        Coverage-based freshness. The message receipt time is irrelevant
        (day-ahead prices published hours ago are still valid). Instead,
        ``ReadinessState`` checks whether the stored timestamped data series
        collectively cover at least ``readiness.min_horizon_hours`` of future
        steps from the current solve start. If they do not, the solve is
        blocked. On short but non-zero coverage a warning is logged.

The trigger topic ``{prefix}/input/trigger`` drives solves. When a message
arrives on the trigger topic and readiness is met, a ``SolveBundle`` is placed
on ``solve_queue``. Data topic messages update stored values but never directly
trigger a solve. This decouples data ingestion from solve scheduling.

Thread safety:
    All public methods acquire ``_lock`` before touching shared state. The lock
    is held only long enough to update or read ``_entries`` — never during a
    solve. This matches the concurrency model described in
    ``IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS §11``.

This module imports from ``mimirheim.core`` and ``mimirheim.config`` but never from
``mimirheim.io``.

class ReadinessState:
    """Tracks per-topic freshness and assembles ``SolveBundle`` when ready.

    One instance lives for the lifetime of the mimirheim process. The MQTT
    ``on_message`` callback calls ``update()`` on every incoming message; the

    Forecast topics use coverage-based readiness: the stored
    ``list[PriceStep]`` or ``list[PowerForecastStep]`` must collectively cover
    at least ``config.readiness.min_horizon_hours`` of future steps. Live
    sensor topics use presence-only readiness: the solving is blocked only if
    no value has ever been received on the topic.
