"""MQTT client wrapper — wires paho to the input parser and readiness state.

This module is deliberately thin. Its only responsibilities are:

1. Wrapping the paho ``Client`` and starting the network loop.
2. Routing ``on_message`` events to ``input_parser`` functions.
3. Passing the parsed values to ``ReadinessState.update()``.
4. Calling ``publisher.republish_last_result()`` from ``on_connect``.
5. Queuing a SolveBundle on ``solve_queue`` when a trigger message arrives.

Solves are only triggered by messages on ``{prefix}/input/trigger``.
Regular data topic messages (prices, PV, battery SOC, etc.) only update
``ReadinessState``; they do not directly queue a solve. This separates data
ingestion from solve scheduling, allowing the scheduler (or an operator) to
control how often the solver runs.

All business logic lives elsewhere:
- Parsing: ``input_parser.py``
- Freshness tracking: ``readiness.py``
- Solving: ``model_builder.py``
- Publishing: ``mqtt_publisher.py``

This module imports from ``mimirheim.io`` (parser, publisher) and ``mimirheim.core``
(readiness, bundle types) but does not import from ``mimirheim.devices`` or call
``build_and_solve`` directly.
