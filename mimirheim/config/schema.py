class PvCapabilitiesConfig(BaseModel):
    """Hardware capability flags for a PV array.

    These flags declare what control outputs the inverter accepts. Enabling a
    capability causes mimirheim to publish a corresponding output topic each solve
    cycle. Capabilities that are False are never published, even if an output
    topic is configured.

    PV arrays support four mutually exclusive (or partially exclusive) control modes:

    1. **Fixed** (no capabilities, no ``production_stages``): mimirheim treats the
       per-step forecast as a constant. No output topics are published. All other
       dispatchable devices schedule around the fixed PV output.

    2. **Continuous power limit** (``power_limit: true``): mimirheim adds a
       continuous decision variable per step, bounded by the forecast. The solver
       may curtail to any value in ``[0, forecast_kw]``. The chosen setpoint is
       published as a kW value each cycle.

    3. **On/off** (``on_off: true``): mimirheim adds a binary per step. The array
       either produces the full forecast or is switched off completely. Mutually
       exclusive with ``power_limit``. Both may be combined: ``pv_kw[t]`` is then
       bounded by ``forecast[t] * pv_on[t]``.

    4. **Staged** (``production_stages`` list in ``PvConfig``): the inverter only
       accepts specific discrete power levels. mimirheim adds one binary variable
       per step per stage; exactly one stage is active at a time. The chosen stage
       register value is published as the ``power_limit_kw`` setpoint. This mode
       is configured entirely via ``PvConfig.production_stages`` — there is no
       corresponding capability flag here. It is mutually exclusive with
       ``power_limit`` and ``on_off``.

    5. **Zero-export** (``zero_export: true``): orthogonal to all modes above.
       When selected by the arbitration engine as the closed-loop enforcer for a
       step, mimirheim publishes ``true`` to the inverter's zero-export register.
       The inverter firmware then uses local CT measurements to prevent grid export
       in real time. mimirheim decides *whether* the mode should be active per
       step; the inverter performs the real-time enforcement autonomously.

    Attributes:
        power_limit: True if the inverter accepts a continuous production limit
            setpoint in kW. Publishing 0.0 turns the array off completely;
            any positive value caps production at that level. Default False.
        zero_export: True if the inverter has a boolean zero-export mode
            register. Default False.
        on_off: True if the inverter supports discrete on/off control only, with
            no intermediate power levels. Mutually exclusive with ``power_limit``.
            Default False.

class DeferrableLoadConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for a deferrable load (e.g. washing machine, dishwasher).

    A deferrable load runs through a fixed power profile — an ordered sequence
    of per-step power levels — within a window supplied at runtime via MQTT.
    The solver chooses the optimal start time within the window to minimise
    total cost. The run takes exactly ``len(power_profile)`` consecutive steps.

    Using a per-step profile rather than a flat ``power_kw`` allows irregular
    consumption patterns to be represented accurately. A washing machine, for
    example, draws high power during the heating phase, low power during the
    wash cycle, and high power again during the spin cycle.

    Once the load physically starts, the external automation publishes the
    actual start datetime to ``topic_committed_start_time`` (retained). From that point
    mimirheim treats the remaining profile steps as fixed draws — no binary variable
    is needed and the window topics are ignored.

    Attributes:
        power_profile: Per-step power draw, in kW. Must be non-empty. Each
            entry is the power drawn during one time step of the run cycle,
            in the order the steps occur. The number of entries determines
            the run duration: ``len(power_profile)`` steps.
            Example: ``[2.0, 0.8, 0.8, 2.5]`` models a 4-step cycle that
            starts and ends at high power with low power in the middle.
        topic_window_earliest: MQTT topic publishing the earliest permitted
            start datetime (ISO 8601 UTC).
        topic_window_latest: MQTT topic publishing the latest permitted end
            datetime. The load must finish by this time.
        topic_committed_start_time: Optional MQTT topic to which the external automation
            publishes the actual start datetime (ISO 8601 UTC, retained) when
            the load physically begins. When this topic is absent or not
            configured, mimirheim never enters the "running" fixed-draw state for
            this load.
        topic_recommended_start_time: Optional MQTT topic to which mimirheim publishes
            the solver-recommended start datetime (ISO 8601 UTC, retained)
            after each solve cycle. An automation can subscribe to this topic
            to program the appliance at the optimal time. The value is the
            UTC datetime of the first nonzero-setpoint step in the schedule
            for this load. When the load is in running or committed state (no
            binary optimisation occurred), nothing is published.

    These parameters describe the thermal behaviour of the building zone being
    controlled. They must be calibrated or estimated from the building's
    construction, insulation, and historical heating data.

    The building is modelled as a single lumped thermal mass (a single-node
    model). This is a first-order approximation suitable for well-mixed spaces
    such as open-plan living areas or underfloor-heated buildings where the
    temperature is reasonably uniform.

    The dynamics equation for each 15-minute step t is:

        T_indoor[t] = alpha * T_prev
                    + (dt / C) * P_heat[t]
                    + beta_outdoor * T_outdoor[t]

    where:
        alpha        = 1 - dt * L / C
        beta_outdoor = dt * L / C
        T_prev       = current_indoor_temp_c for t=0; T_indoor[t-1] for t>0
        P_heat[t]    = thermal power the HP delivers at step t (kW)

    All terms are linear in the solver variables.

    ``alpha`` is the share of the indoor-to-outdoor temperature difference the
    building still holds after one step, so it must lie strictly between 0 and
    1. That makes ``thermal_capacity_kwh_per_k`` and ``heat_loss_coeff_kw_per_k``
    jointly constrained rather than independent, and the pair is checked by
    ``_validate_thermal_stability``.

    Attributes:
        thermal_capacity_kwh_per_k: Effective thermal mass of the building in
            kWh per degree Kelvin. Represents how much energy is stored or
            released when the indoor temperature changes by 1 °C. Typical
            values range from 3–5 kWh/K for a small well-insulated apartment
            to 15–40 kWh/K for a large passive house with concrete floors.
            Can be estimated from the time the building takes to cool by 1 °C
            when the HP is off in calm weather. Must exceed
            ``0.25 * heat_loss_coeff_kw_per_k`` so that ``alpha`` stays above
            zero; see ``_validate_thermal_stability``.
        heat_loss_coeff_kw_per_k: Building heat loss coefficient in kW per
            degree Kelvin of indoor–outdoor temperature difference. At a 15 °C
            delta, a coefficient of 0.5 kW/K means 7.5 kW of heat is needed
            to maintain temperature. Typical range: 0.05 kW/K (very well
            insulated) to 1.5 kW/K (draughty older building). Must stay below
            ``thermal_capacity_kwh_per_k / 0.25``; see
            ``_validate_thermal_stability``.
        comfort_min_c: Minimum acceptable indoor temperature in degrees
            Celsius. The solver will not allow T_indoor to drop below this
            value at any step. Default 19.0 °C.
        comfort_max_c: Maximum acceptable indoor temperature in degrees
            Celsius. Pre-heating is bounded by this ceiling. Default 24.0 °C.
        inputs: MQTT input topic configuration. None is allowed in unit tests
            where live data is injected directly via SpaceHeatingInputs or
            CombiHeatPumpInputs.

        cooling_rate_k_per_hour: Rate at which the tank temperature falls in

class CombiHeatPumpConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for a combined DHW and space heating heat pump.

    A combi heat pump has a single compressor that can operate in two mutually
    exclusive modes each time step: DHW mode heats the hot water storage tank;
    SH mode delivers heat to the space heating circuit (e.g. underfloor heating
    or radiators). The device cannot run in both modes simultaneously.

    DHW mode typically has a lower COP than SH mode because heating water to a
    high setpoint (55 °C or above) requires a larger temperature lift than
    heating a low-temperature floor circuit (35 °C). The separate ``cop_dhw``
    and ``cop_sh`` parameters capture this asymmetry and influence which mode
    the solver prefers at each price step.

    The tank model (temperature dynamics, hard bounds) is identical to
    ``ThermalBoilerDevice``. The space heating model (degree-days demand,
    minimum run) is identical to ``SpaceHeatingDevice`` in on/off mode. The
    unique constraint in this device is the mutual exclusion between the two
    modes.

    Attributes:
        elec_power_kw: Rated electrical power in kW. Applied at this level in
            both DHW and SH modes (same compressor power for both).
        cop_dhw: COP in DHW (domestic hot water) mode. Lower than cop_sh
            because of the higher temperature lift to the tank setpoint.
        cop_sh: COP in space heating mode.
        volume_liters: DHW tank water volume in litres.
        setpoint_c: Target DHW water temperature in degrees Celsius. The
            solver will not heat the tank above this temperature.
        min_temp_c: Minimum allowable DHW water temperature in degrees Celsius.
            The solver enforces this as a hard constraint. Must be strictly
            less than setpoint_c.
        cooling_rate_k_per_hour: DHW tank cooling rate in K/h, combining
            insulation losses and expected hot water draws.
        min_run_steps: Minimum consecutive 15-minute steps the HP must run
            once started, across both modes combined. A mode switch (e.g.
            DHW→SH) within a running block counts as continuous operation.
        wear_cost_eur_per_kwh: Cycling cost per kWh of electrical consumption
            in EUR. Discourages unnecessary cycling.
        inputs: MQTT input topic configuration. Required for live operation.
