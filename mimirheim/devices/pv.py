"""PV device — fixed forecast or solver-controlled generation.

An array is in exactly one of four control modes, chosen by config. The modes
describe genuinely different hardware and the schema rejects any combination of
them (see ``PvCapabilitiesConfig._validate_mutually_exclusive_modes`` and
``PvConfig._validate_production_stages``), so ``add_constraints`` dispatches on
them with a single if/elif chain.

**Fixed** (no capability enabled, no stages). mimirheim does not control the
array. The per-step forecast enters the power balance as a constant and
dispatchable devices schedule around it.

**Continuous** (``capabilities.power_limit``). Models an inverter that accepts a
power limit setpoint, such as an SMA, Kostal or Fronius. mimirheim adds a
continuous variable ``pv_kw[t]`` bounded by the forecast, so the solver can
curtail to any level when exporting would be costly. Sending zero is how such an
inverter is switched off; there is no separate on/off register.

**Binary** (``capabilities.on_off``). Models an inverter or relay with no
setpoint register at all, which can only run or not run. mimirheim adds a binary
``pv_curtailed[t]``: 0 means the array is running and produces the full
forecast, 1 means it is switched off. Curtailment carries a negligible objective
penalty (1e-6 EUR per step) so the solver defaults to running when indifferent.

**Staged** (``production_stages``). Models an inverter that accepts a fixed
enumeration of output levels including zero, such as an Enphase IQ Combiner.
mimirheim adds one binary ``stage_active[t, s]`` per step per stage, constrains
exactly one to be active, and uses the precomputed
``min(forecast[t], stage_kw[s])`` as the effective output.

``PvInputs`` is defined here because it is a direct input to this device's
``add_constraints`` method. It is not a runtime MQTT model with staleness checks
— the forecast list arrives as a single decoded payload each solve cycle.

This module does not import from ``mimirheim.io``. It does not import ``python-mip``.
