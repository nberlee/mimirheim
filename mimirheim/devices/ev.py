"""EV charger device — models a vehicle battery with optional V2H discharge.

This module is structurally similar to ``battery.py`` with three key differences:

1. **Availability gate**: when the vehicle is not plugged in (``available=False``),
   all charge and discharge variables are forced to zero and no SOC tracking
   is performed.

2. **Charging window constraint**: when ``available=True``,
   ``inputs.window_latest`` is set, and ``inputs.target_soc_kwh`` is set,
   the SOC must reach ``inputs.target_soc_kwh`` by the step that corresponds
   to ``window_latest``. This is a hard constraint — the solver is not allowed
   to deliver the vehicle below its target charge.

3. **Discharge segments optional**: if ``config.discharge_segments`` is empty,
   no discharge variables are declared and the mode guard is skipped.

``solve_time_utc`` is accepted as an argument to ``add_constraints`` so that
window datetimes can be translated to step indices. It must be supplied by the
model builder; it is not fetched from the IO layer.

This module does not import from ``mimirheim.io``. All solver interactions go through
``ModelContext.solver`` (a ``SolverBackend``); ``python-mip`` is never imported here.

        Called by ``build_and_solve`` when two or more EV chargers are present,
        to enforce a shared system charge/discharge direction across all EVs.
        This prevents energy from circulating between EVs (one V2H-discharging
        while another charges) with no net gain to the system.

        The shared binary ``ev_system_mode[t]`` has the same semantics as the
        per-device mode:

        - 1 = all EVs are in the charging direction this step.
        - 0 = all EVs are in the discharging direction this step.

        For charge-only EVs (no ``discharge_segments``), ``mode[t]`` is never
        created by ``add_variables`` and is never read by ``add_constraints``
        (the Big-M discharge guard is skipped when ``has_v2h=False``). Calling
        this method on a charge-only EV injects the shared variable into
        ``self.mode`` but has no effect on the solver model. This is intentional:
        the activation logic is uniform across all EV chargers regardless of
        V2H capability.

        Must be called before ``add_variables``. ``add_variables`` skips
        creating a per-device binary for any step already present in
        ``self.mode``, so calling in that order leaves no orphaned variables
        behind.
