# homeassistant — Base load forecast from Home Assistant statistics

**homeassistant** is a standalone daemon that derives a base load forecast from the historical statistics of a power sensor in Home Assistant and publishes it to the mimirheim static load forecast topic.

## 1. Purpose

mimirheim requires a per-step base load forecast for each configured `static_loads` entry before each solve. The base load is the household's uncontrollable power consumption that mimirheim must account for but cannot influence — fridge, lighting, standby, cooking, etc.

This tool generates that forecast by querying Home Assistant's long-term statistics API for a power sensor. It computes a "typical" load profile by averaging the same time-of-day readings across several recent days, then publishes the result in the mimirheim timestamped-steps format.

---

## 2. How it works

### Trigger model

The tool subscribes to a single MQTT trigger topic and acts on every message. It calls the HA REST API on demand — it does not poll continuously. Because base load patterns are stable on daily timescales, triggering once per day (e.g. at midnight) is usually sufficient to keep the forecast current.

### Forecasting method

The tool uses a **same-hour average over recent days** as the base load forecast for each future hour:

1. It queries HA's statistics API for hourly mean values of all configured entities over the last `lookback_days` days.
2. It converts every reading to kW and merges all entities into one net series per timestamp: `net(t) = sum(sum_entities at t) - sum(subtract_entities at t)`. An entity with no reading at `t` contributes zero at `t`. Timestamps at which no `sum_entities` entry has a reading are skipped, so a subtract entity never produces a purely negative hour on its own.
3. For each hour of the day (0–23) it computes the mean of `net(t)` across all same-hour timestamps in the lookback window and clamps it to zero — baseload is never negative.
4. This 24-hour profile is then repeated to fill the full `horizon_hours` window, starting from the current wall-clock hour.

Merging before averaging is what makes a sensor handover work. When a sensor is renamed or replaced, list both the old and the new entity in `sum_entities`: the old one carries the early part of the lookback window, the new one the recent part, and together they read as one continuous series. Averaging each entity on its own over the days it has data and then summing would count both at full strength even though they never overlapped.

This is a simple but robust approach. It produces reasonable forecasts without requiring machine learning, handles seasonal variation only coarsely (a longer `lookback_days` averages it out), and degrades gracefully when some historical data is missing.

### Power sensor units

HA sensors commonly report power in watts (`W`) or kilowatts (`kW`). The tool converts to kilowatts before publishing, using the `unit` field in config.

All fields are required unless a default is shown. The tool rejects unknown fields.

### Field reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `mqtt.host` | string | MQTT broker hostname or IP address |
| `mqtt.port` | integer | MQTT broker port. Default: `1883` |
| `mqtt.client_id` | string | MQTT client identifier. Must be unique on the broker |
| `mqtt.username` | string | Optional broker username |
| `mqtt.password` | string | Optional broker password |
| `trigger_topic` | string | MQTT topic that triggers a fetch-and-publish cycle |
| `output_topic` | string | MQTT topic to publish the base load forecast to (retained). Must match the corresponding `static_loads.*.topic_forecast` in mimirheim config |
| `homeassistant.url` | string | Base URL of your HA instance, including scheme and port |
| `homeassistant.token` | string | A Long-Lived Access Token generated in HA (Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens) |
| `homeassistant.sum_entities` | list of strings | Entity IDs whose hourly mean power is summed to form the gross load. At least one entity is required |
| `homeassistant.subtract_entities` | list of strings | Entity IDs whose hourly mean power is subtracted from the sum. Use this to remove steered loads (battery, PV, deferred loads) that mimirheim already schedules. May be empty |
| `homeassistant.unit` | string | Unit reported by all entities: `W` or `kW`. The tool converts to kW before publishing. All entities must use the same unit |
| `homeassistant.lookback_days` | integer 1–30 | Number of recent days to average. Higher values smooth out anomalies but respond more slowly to lifestyle changes. Default recommended: `7` |
| `homeassistant.horizon_hours` | integer 1–168 | Number of hours of forecast to publish. The 24-hour day profile is repeated to fill the horizon. Default: `24` |
| `signal_mimir` | boolean | Publish to `mimir_trigger_topic` after publishing the base load payload. Default `false` |
| `mimir_trigger_topic` | string | mimirheim's trigger topic. Required when `signal_mimir: true` |

### Getting a Long-Lived Access Token

1. Open Home Assistant.
2. Click your username in the lower-left corner → **Profile**.
3. Scroll down to **Long-Lived Access Tokens** and click **Create Token**.
4. Copy the token and paste it into config. The token is only shown once.

## 4. Output format

Published retained to `output_topic`. Steps are hourly. mimirheim resamples to its 15-minute solver grid using linear interpolation.

```json
[
  {"ts": "2026-03-30T14:00:00+00:00", "kw": 0.42},
  {"ts": "2026-03-30T15:00:00+00:00", "kw": 0.38},
  {"ts": "2026-03-30T16:00:00+00:00", "kw": 0.51},
  {"ts": "2026-03-30T17:00:00+00:00", "kw": 0.89},
  {"ts": "2026-03-30T18:00:00+00:00", "kw": 1.23}
]
```

- `ts` is UTC ISO 8601 with `+00:00` offset, marking the start of each hour.
- `kw` is the net forecast power in kilowatts: sum of `sum_entities` minus sum of `subtract_entities`, clamped to zero.
- No `confidence` field is included. mimirheim treats absent confidence as 1.0.
- The forecast covers `horizon_hours` hours from the current wall-clock hour. If `horizon_hours` exceeds 24, the 24-hour day profile is tiled to fill the full window.

## 6. Fault tolerance

- **HTTP failure**: If the HA REST API returns an error (network failure, 401, 500), the cycle is aborted and the error is logged. The last retained payload on `output_topic` remains unchanged.
- **Insufficient history**: If fewer than `lookback_days` days of data are available (e.g. on first run), the tool computes the average over however many days are available. If no history exists at all for a given hour, the tool falls back to the mean across all available readings. This fallback is logged at `WARNING` level.
- **Missing hours**: HA statistics can have gaps. An hour at which no `sum_entities` entry has a reading is absent from the average. An hour at which some entities have a reading and others do not is kept, with the missing entities counted as zero for that hour.
- **MQTT disconnect**: Reconnects automatically.

---

## 7. Scheduling

Once daily at midnight is the standard cadence, refreshing the forecast for the coming day. If your household load is highly variable (e.g. you work from home some days and not others), updating more frequently does not help — the historical average is a fixed profile. A longer `lookback_days` is a better approach for absorbing variability.

Example scheduler entry:

```yaml
schedules:
  baseload:
    cron: "0 0 * * *"
    trigger_topic: mimir/input/tools/baseload/trigger
```

---

## 8. HA prerequisites

The tool calls the HA statistics API endpoint:

```
GET {url}/api/recorder/statistics_during_period
```

This endpoint requires:

- **HA version 2022.11 or later** — the statistics API was stabilised in this release.
- **The recorder integration enabled** (it is enabled by default in HA). Statistics are stored in the HA SQLite or MariaDB database.
- **Long-term statistics for the entity** — HA automatically stores hourly mean statistics for entities with `state_class: measurement` (which is the correct class for power sensors). If your power sensor does not have this class, HA will not have hourly statistics for it; check the entity in Settings → Entities.
- **The Long-Lived Access Token** must have read access to the statistics API (all HA tokens do by default).

### Verifying your sensor has statistics

In Home Assistant: **Developer Tools → Statistics**. Search for your entity. If it appears, statistics are available and this tool will work. If it does not appear, check the entity's `state_class` attribute.
