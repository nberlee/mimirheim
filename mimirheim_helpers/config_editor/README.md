# config-editor — Web-based configuration editor

**config-editor** is a lightweight web interface for editing mimirheim and
helper YAML configuration files inside the running container. It serves a
single-page application that renders validated forms for every configuration
model, reads the current config files from `/config`, and writes changes back
atomically.

## 1. Purpose

All other mimirheim services read their configuration from YAML files at
startup or on restart. config-editor provides a browser-based interface to
create and edit those files without needing shell access to the container or
a separate file editor add-on.

config-editor is the only component in the stack with no MQTT connection. It
is a web server that reads and writes files in the `/config` directory.

---

## 2. How it works

At startup, config-editor:

1. Loads `config-editor.yaml` and validates it against `ConfigEditorConfig`.
2. Starts a `ThreadingHTTPServer` on the configured port (default 8099).
3. Imports `MimirheimConfig` and all available helper config models to build
   JSON schemas. These schemas are computed once and cached for the lifetime of
   the process.
4. Serves the single-page editor frontend and JSON API endpoints until
   SIGTERM or SIGINT.

The frontend uses the JSON Schema for each config model to display a validated
form. Submitting the form sends the edited dict as a POST body; the server
validates it against the Pydantic model before writing the file, so invalid
configurations are rejected before they can break anything.

Config files are written atomically: the new content is first written to a
temporary file in the same directory, then renamed into place. This ensures
the previous config file is never partially overwritten.

---

## 3. Configuration

Create `config-editor.yaml` in `/config` (or pass any path with `--config`).
An empty file is valid and enables the editor with all defaults.

```yaml
# All fields are optional. Defaults are shown.

# TCP port the editor listens on.
# port: 8099

# Directory containing the mimirheim YAML config files.
# Must match the container /config bind-mount or addon_config path.
# config_dir: /config

# Python logging level: DEBUG, INFO, or WARNING.
# log_level: INFO
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `port` | int | `8099` | TCP port. Must be in range 1024–65535. |
| `config_dir` | path | `/config` | Directory where config files are read from and written to. |
| `log_level` | string | `INFO` | Python logging level name. |

### HA add-on: allowed_ip

When running as a HA add-on, the `CONFIG_EDITOR_ALLOWED_IP` environment
variable is injected automatically by the container init scripts. The server
uses this to restrict access to the HA ingress proxy IP (the container's
default gateway), preventing direct LAN access to the editor. This field
does not appear in `config-editor.yaml` and cannot be set manually.

---

## 4. HTTP API

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/` | Single-page editor frontend |
| `GET` | `/static/<file>` | Frontend static assets |
| `GET` | `/api/schema` | `MimirheimConfig` JSON Schema |
| `GET` | `/api/config` | Current `mimirheim.yaml` as `{"exists": bool, "config": dict}` |
| `POST` | `/api/config` | Validate dict body and write `mimirheim.yaml`. Returns `{"ok": true}` or `{"ok": false, "errors": ...}` |
| `GET` | `/api/helper-configs` | Dict mapping each helper filename to `{"enabled": bool, "config": dict}` |
| `GET` | `/api/helper-schemas` | Dict mapping each helper filename to its JSON Schema |
| `POST` | `/api/helper-config/<filename>` | Body `{"enabled": true, "config": {...}}` writes the file. `{"enabled": false}` deletes it. |

All responses are `application/json`. Error responses use standard HTTP status
codes: 400 for malformed JSON, 403 for disallowed IP, 404 for unknown paths,
422 for Pydantic validation failures.

---

## 5. Running

### In a container (default)

config-editor starts automatically when `config-editor.yaml` is present in
`/config`. No additional steps are required.

### Standalone

```bash
uv run python -m config_editor --config /config/config-editor.yaml
```

Access the editor at `http://<host>:8099`.

---

## 6. Security

config-editor has no authentication. It is designed for use on a trusted
private network or inside a container behind the HA ingress proxy.

**Do not expose port 8099 directly to an untrusted network.** The editor
can read and write all config files in `/config` including MQTT passwords.

When running as a HA add-on, ingress provides HA session-based authentication
and the `allowed_ip` restriction further limits accepted connections to the
ingress proxy. Direct LAN access returns HTTP 403.
